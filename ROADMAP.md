# TONK-RE Roadmap

Planned and proposed features, grouped by impact. Not committed to dates — a backlog to pull from.
Contributions welcome; open an issue to claim one.

## Shipped

- Decompile `.apk/.xapk/.apks/.apkm` (jadx + apktool)
- Manifest attack-surface summary (exported components, deep links, permissions, flags, native libs, framework detection)
- Secret / URL / crypto-security scanners, regex search (java/smali/resources)
- Syntax-highlighted editor, Java ⇄ smali bridge
- Rebuild & sign (apktool / zipalign / apksigner), with code-only build fallback when resource re-linking fails
- `RESIGN APK`, `INSTALL ▸ ADB`
- Deep-link / intent tester (exported components + deep links as `adb am` commands)
- Version diff (permissions / components / classes / URLs / flags)
- Frida hook generator (trace / stacktrace / return-override / SSL & root bypass)
- **Native `.so` analysis** — pure-stdlib ELF parser: arch, JNI entry points, exports/imports, NEEDED libs, exploit mitigations (NX/RELRO/canary/FORTIFY), URLs/strings + secret scan; shown read-only in the editor. Optional radare2 pseudo-code backend (`decompile_native`).
- **One-click "Make interceptable" (MITM) patch** — debuggable + a `network_security_config` trusting user CA certs + cleartext, via the `[ PATCH ▾ ]` menu (`make_interceptable`).
- **Guided smali patches** — right-click a method → force return true/false, return null/0, no-op → smali rewrite, then BUILD (`patch_method`). Static counterpart to the Frida generator.
- **Editor method menu** — right-click a Java/smali method for Frida (trace / override return), "ask Claude for a Frida hook", and the guided smali patches above.
- **Report export** — one-click `[ REPORT ↯ ]` (and `export_report` / `tonkre report`) writes `AUDIT.md` into the project: manifest attack surface, hard-coded secrets, endpoints, crypto/security findings and the signing cert, with file:line evidence and a risk summary.
- **Resource viewer** — click a drawable/icon (`png/jpg/webp/gif/bmp/ico`) to render it instead of raw bytes; `[ TABLE ▦ ]` renders a `res/values*` XML (strings, arrays, colors…) as a filterable name/value table.
- **Sensitive-API usage + permission cross-reference** — `find_api_usage` / `tonkre apis` / `[ APIS ]` catalog which Android APIs the app calls (location, device IDs, SMS, camera, mic, clipboard, crypto, reflection, process exec, dynamic loading, root checks, …) grouped by capability, and flag APIs used without a matching permission / permissions declared but unused (engine: `apis.py`).
- **Method-level version diff** — the version diff now lists added/removed method signatures per changed class, not just the changed-class list.
- **Secret entropy filtering** — the loose `generic_secret` pattern is filtered by Shannon entropy and placeholder words, and ranked most-random-first, to cut false positives.
- **Engine self-test** — `tonkre selftest` runs offline sanity checks of the pure engines; `tests/` holds stdlib `unittest` coverage runnable with no install.
- Built-in Claude assistant (conversation memory, editable pre-prompt, orange tree-flash on file reads)
- Missing-tool handling + setup banner, apktool version warning + updater
- Cross-platform (macOS/Windows/Linux), native macOS Dock app, MCP server for Claude Code

## Biggest capability gaps (next)

- [ ] **Native pseudo-code in the GUI** — surface `decompile_native` (radare2) in the editor with a function picker; bundle/offer a Ghidra-headless backend for richer output. (ELF structural analysis already ships.)
- [ ] **More guided patches** — "neutralize a specific call" (remove an `invoke-*` + its `move-result`), signature/integrity-check bypass, and overload-specific targeting (by descriptor, not just name).
- [ ] **Patch review/undo** — show a diff of what a one-click patch changed, and a one-click revert (re-decompile or keep a backup of edited smali/manifest).

## Dynamic analysis (uses adb / maestro)

- [ ] **Device panel** — list devices, screenshot, pull/push files.
- [ ] **Live logcat viewer** — stream logcat filtered to the package; pairs with the intent tester.
- [ ] **Run + observe** — launch via adb and capture logcat around a triggered action.

## Quick wins

- [ ] **Tracker / SDK detection** — flag bundled ad / analytics / tracking SDKs (Exodus-style signatures) in the INFO panel.
- [ ] **Claude "full audit" button** — one click runs a structured Claude pass over the static report and writes `AUDIT-claude.md` (narrative findings, confirmed-in-context), complementing the static `export_report` (`AUDIT.md`).
- [ ] **Per-project bookmarks / notes** — mark interesting classes / lines while exploring.

## Polish

- [ ] **CI** — `py_compile` + a headless smoke test on push.
- [ ] **Demo GIF** in the README.
- [ ] **Native window** on Windows/Linux (currently a Chromium app window), matching the macOS app.
